# Resume Fraud Detection

Recruiters are receiving too many resumes to read through them these days.  Instead, a lot of them use Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to simplify the recruiting processes by easily narrow down the applicant pool. One of the most common way ATS selects ideal candidate is keyword search. As a result, there are applicants who added transparent keywords to ensure ATS rank their resumes with high relevance, which is known as keyword stuffing. 

As for this project, our group wants to spot this type of behaviors by detecting and highlighting any hidden words existed in resumes. 

In addition, I created a resume scoring system to mimic the algorithm of ATS.
